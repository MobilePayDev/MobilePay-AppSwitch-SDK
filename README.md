# MobilePay AppSwitch SDK
The MobilePay SDK enables your app to receive payments through the MobilePay app.
![][1]

**How it works**  
1 - You initiate the payment from your own app through the SDK.

2 - It automatically switches to the MobilePay App where the user is asked to sign in.

3 - The user confirms the payment.

4 - The receipt is shown and the user can either tap "videre" or wait one second. A counter is showing the time remaining.

5 - MobilePay switches back to your own app together with a MobilePay transactionId.

## MerchantID for test purposes
The MerchantID for testing depends on which country you are targeting. The following IDs can be used:

**APPDK0000000000** - Denmark

**APPNO0000000000** - Norway

**APPFI0000000000** - Finland

When the test MerchantID is used you are able to complete the payment flow without transferring any money.
